    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>My name is Riona Wong,</h2>
    <p>
      I was <em>born</em> in Macau, China but I was <em>raised</em> in Canada
      for a large majority of my life. After high school, I attended the
      University of the Fraser Valley for health science but I decided to take a
      break from school because I did not want to pursue the field anymore.
      During my break, I developed a strong love for traveling. I was fortunate
      to have the time and opportunity to travel to many cities around the world
      but there are still a lot of places I want to visit.
    </p>
    <p>So far, I have traveled to <strong>16</strong> cities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Calgary, Canada</li>
      <li>Toronto, Canada</li>
      <li>Seattle, Washington</li>
      <li>Portland, Oregon</li>
      <li>Los Angeles, California</li>
      <li>San Francisco, California</li>
      <li>Miami, Florida</li>
      <li>Chicago, Illinois</li>
      <li>Honolulu, Hawaii</li>
      <li>Macau, China</li>
      <li>Hong Kong, China</li>
      <li>Taipei, Taiwan</li>
      <li>Singapore, Republic of Singapore</li>
      <li>Seoul, South Korea</li>
      <li>Jakarta, Indonesia</li>
      <li>Paris, France</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      My interest in the Computer Information Field stemmed from the pandemic.
      During the total lockdown, nobody was able to work unless your career
      allowed you to “work from home”. Information System Technicians were the
      specialists that helped allow people to work during the full lockdown and
      I began to wonder about how everything worked and how it was possible for
      people to work from their personal computers.
