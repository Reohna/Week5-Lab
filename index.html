            <div class="intro">
            I was <em>born</em> in Macau, China but I was <em>raised</em> in
            Canada for a large majority of my life. After high school, I
            attended the University of the Fraser Valley for health science but
            I decided to take a break from school because I did not want to
            pursue the field anymore. During my break, I developed a strong love
            for traveling. I was fortunate to have the time and opportunity to
            travel to many cities around the world but there are still a lot of
            places I want to visit.
            So far, I have traveled to <strong>16</strong> cities:
          <ul>
            <li>Calgary, Canada</li>
            <li>Toronto, Canada</li>
            <li>Seattle, Washington</li>
            <li>Portland, Oregon</li>
            <li>Los Angeles, California</li>
            <li>San Francisco, California</li>
            <li>Miami, Florida</li>
            <li>Chicago, Illinois</li>
            <li>Boston, Massachusetts</li>
            <li>Honolulu, Hawaii</li>
            <li>Cancun, Mexico</li>
            <li>Macau, China</li>
            <li>Hong Kong, China</li>
            <li>Taipei, Taiwan</li>
            <li>Singapore, Republic of Singapore</li>
            <li>Seoul, South Korea</li>
            <li>Jakarta, Indonesia</li>
            <li>Paris, France</li>
            <li>Utretcht, Netherlands</li>
          </ul>

            My interest in the Computer Information Field stemmed from the
            pandemic. During the total lockdown, nobody was able to work unless
            your career allowed you to “work from home”. Information System
            Technicians were the specialists that helped allow people to work
            during the full lockdown and I began to wonder about how everything
            worked and how it was possible for people to work from their
            personal computers.
